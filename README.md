Description: TO-DO List Project

# Overview:
I created a to-do list in Python. So let's begin. As we run our program we will be prompted. With a list of actions we can take. You want to do VR work that we can type in v.And as you can see there are currently. No more work. Our list to make a toss. We'll type in C and what it will do to us immediately. For tasks we want to add to our list. For example we can type. Hi, I'm Areeba.And press V again as you can see.

The task has been added to the list. Maybe we can create multiple tasks. There will be another. Hello, David. And press v again as you can see the task is added to the list we can create a task well type in c. Final-project Complete. With type in v and as you can see. Added to our list are three things we can do. Press U to update the toss. And it will also change the tasks we want. I want to update the third one

instead of doing Final-project Complete maybe we'll Final-Project Complete.  I'll press V again and as you can see. The third work has been edited.
